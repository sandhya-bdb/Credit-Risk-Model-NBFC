## Overview

A Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) based in India is partnering with a leading AI service provider — to develop a sophisticated credit risk model. The goal is to build a robust predictive model and an associated credit scorecard that categorizes loan applications into **Poor, Average, Good, and Excellent** categories based on patterns similar to the CIBIL scoring system.

---

## 🔍 Project Scope

### **1. Model Development**
- Develop a predictive machine learning model based on historical loan and default data from the Finance company.
- Build a dataset pipeline that ingests customer information, loan details, and bureau credit attributes.

### **2. Credit Scorecard Creation**
- Produce a scoring mechanism that assigns credit categories (Poor, Average, Good, Excellent).
- Translate model outputs into actionable business-friendly scores suitable for credit underwriting.

### **3. Streamlit UI Application**
- Build a user-friendly Streamlit application.
- The UI will enable loan officers to input borrower demographics, loan parameters, and bureau data to:
  - Predict default probability
  - Output an interpretable credit rating

## 🧠 Scope of Work

### **1. Model Development**
- Build a predictive model using Lauki Finance’s historical loan data.  
- Handle class imbalance using techniques like under-sampling and resampling.  
- Train and evaluate models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

### **2. Scorecard Creation**
- Translate model outputs into a **credit scorecard**.  
- Categorize credit quality into:
  - **Poor**
  - **Average**
  - **Good**
  - **Excellent**

### **3. Streamlit UI Application**
- A web interface where loan officers can input:
  - Borrower demographics  
  - Loan details  
  - Bureau credit information  
- The app returns:
  - Default probability  
  - Credit score rating
